    <br><h2>MACRO-SUMMARY</h2>
    <p><h4>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h4>Our project aims to display pandemic learning loss visually on both a national and a state level. Our data compares
      the average math scores of 8th graders in 2019 versus 2022, and we have found that the average scores have declined in almost
      every single state. We hope to demonstrate insight into how the pandemic has affected learning for different demographics. </p>
   <p><h4>INSERT INFOGRAPHIC</h4></p>
   <p>At least three bullet points listing interesting, text-based perspectives gleaned from the data that expand upon what is visible in the infographic. </p>
   <p>The first potentially problematic aspect of our visualization is that the US map is not proportional (in terms of size) for every state.
   This is the same problem that election maps raise -- that the state sizes are unproportional, and from just looking at the map it seems like the Republican
   candidate has won by a landslide, when in fact a lot of Democratic states are smaller in size, but hold the same weight. We could have had proportional
   squares for each state, which are laid out like the US map so that it is still recognizable as a map, but each of the states are visually weighted equally. </p>
   <p>The second potentially problematic aspect of our visualization is that we weren't sure what colors to use on our map. We were debating whether to use only
   shades of red or whether to use two different colors fading into each other. In using different colors, we could make one color signify that the state's percent decrease
   was above the national average and the other color signify that the percent change was below the national average. Ultimately, we decided to use only shades of red,
   because the point of our project was to show pandemic learning loss, and we thought that red naturally signified decreasing. </p>
